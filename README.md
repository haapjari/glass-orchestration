# Greetings

Hello! I am Jari Haapasaari ([mail](mailto:haapjari@gmail.com)), and this is an orchestration repository, for my research tool, that I built for my thesis.

---

## About

This repository contains `docker-compose.yml` file and instructions, how to replicate the thesis setup. 

Project is called `glass`, because I's like magnifying glass to open-source repositories hosted in GitHub.

### Components

### Glass UI

- [Repository](https://github.com/haapjari/glass-ui)
- Visualizes the results.
- Offers orchestration methods and ability to visualize the results.

### Glass API

- [Repository](https://github.com/haapjari/glass-api)
- REST API, that fetches data from GitHub.
- API also calculates the missing fields from the data.

### Glass Draw

- [Repository](https://github.com/haapjari/glass-draw)
- Component leverages scientific libraries in 
- Component reads data from the database, and  

### Database

- PostgreSQL database.

### How-To: Run

- This guide will walk you through the steps to clone, build, and run the Glass application components using Docker Compose. This process involves cloning the necessary repositories, building Docker images for each component, and running the services using Docker Compose.
Prerequisites

- Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

```bash
    git
    docker
    docker-compose
```

#### Step 1: Clone the Orchestration Repository

- clone the `glass-orchestration`repository to your local machine:

``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/haapjari/glass-orchestration.git
    cd glass-orchestration
```

#### Step 2: Clone Component Repositories

- Run the provided script to clone the individual component repositories:

```bash
    ./sct/clone_repos.sh
```

- This script clones the following repositories into the current directory:

```bash
    glass-ui
    glass-api
    glass-draw
```

#### Step 3: Build Docker Images

- Build docker images for each component. This step uses the Dockerfiles located in each component's repository to create the images:

```bash
    make build
```

#### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the application by launching all services defined in the Docker Compose configuration:

```bash
    make up
```

This command runs the services in detached mode. To view logs from all services, you can use:

```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Step 5: Accessing the Application

After starting the services, you can access the application components as follows:

- Glass UI: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Glass API: The API is available at http://localhost:4000
- Glass Draw: Access the drawing component at http://localhost:5000

Shutting Down

To stop and remove all running containers associated with the application, use the following command:

```bash
    make down
```
